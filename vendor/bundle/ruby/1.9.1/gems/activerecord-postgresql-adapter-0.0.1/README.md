activerecord-postgresql-adapter
===============================

This is a dummy gem that forwards to the postgresql adapter "pg", so taht the following rails suggestion works:

`Please install the postgresql adapter: 'gem install activerecord-postgresql-adapter' (Could not find pg (~> 0.11) amongst [...]) (LoadError)`
